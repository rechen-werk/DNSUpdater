# DNSUpdater
DNS Updater for World4You.
## Good to know:
Provide username and password as parameters
Define the IDs which should be handled by the program in `~/.rechenwerk/world4you/ids` which will be generated on first run.
This program is intended to be used in combination with crontabs. (May be changed in a later version)

## TODO
Add error handling, currently the program just doesnt work if you provide invalid date like username, password and ids
